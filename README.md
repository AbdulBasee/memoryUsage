Your name:
Question 2: I get the following statistics of my CPU usage
total: 7.8 Gi
Used: 826Mi
Free: 6.2 Gi
Availabel 6.7 Gi

I think this answer correctly depicts my CPU usage. I confirmed this by using another tool that shows the result of the CPU usage.

Question 4: I think when I ran the free command, I noticed a change in the memory usage of my cpu, since the program file was running
infinitely
As the program was running without being stopped, the amount of memory usage was increasing

For large amount of memory the memory usage is even higher



Question 7) For this question I used the command pmap PID to check the memory consumption of the process. For this example I did select my chrome browser. It did show me the list of hexadecmial memory usage for all the process in the chrome

Q8) After running the command for this program I do see a minor difference compared to the process with the browser.
There are fewer list of hexadecmial address spaces.
